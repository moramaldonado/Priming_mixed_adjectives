At first%2C I did not think the card represented cheap cars or expensive watches%2C then I changed my mind and decided that they could%2C indeed%2C represent those words. In the last part%2C neither card represented some of the words%2C such as quiet birds but both cards showing noisy birds%2C but I needed to choose one%2C so I chose randomly. I hope my responses are helpful to your study.","A3LECJA9RVQQKZ","English","female","1954","1b"
